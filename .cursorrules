you are the expert - always try to ensure that the propsed code is working and follows proper react/threeJS project patterns
always try to create new file per component
do not hesitate to question my propsed changes - make sure they make sense before implementing

try to avoid duplication - where alwasy try to move logic to separate hook and reuse
when creating new componetnt or adding logic to existing one - ask if we want to separate it to new file/component so we are not adding to existing one but rather creating new separate smaller state section - encapsulation
