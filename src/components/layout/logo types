we want to support different canvas sizes for different logo types
konva canvas should handle resolution of 2048/2048 but should be scaled down to canvasSize
so if imported image is in reality 2048/2048 it should not loose quality - only preview should be scaled down
resulting texture is always 2048/2048

so we need to  keep track of currently selecet logo type to update canvas size
